\begin{abstract}
Many business process models have control-flow anomalies, such as deadlocks or livelocks, which can hinder proper execution.
In this paper, we introduce our new tool that can instantaneously identify anomalies in BPMN models, make them comprehensible for modelers, and even suggest corrections to resolve them automatically.
We demonstrate that our tool's detection is instantaneous, i.e., it takes less than 500ms, by benchmarking our tool against synthetic BPMN models with increasing size and state space complexity, as well as realistic models provided in the literature.
Moreover, the tool directly displays detected anomalies in the model and provides an interactive visualization.
Additionally, it provides fixes to resolve the anomalies found, which are not currently available in other tools.
The tool is open-source, modular, extensible, and integrated into a popular BPMN modeling tool.
